# Sage 10 with Gutenberg Full Site Editing (FSE)

## Requirements

- A [patched `roots/acorn` package](https://github.com/roots/acorn/pull/141) is used by the theme as theme runtime dependency (in theme [`composer.json`](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/composer.json#L43-L49)) which loader preserves the block template paths.
- `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` must be absent, as FSE will not work otherwise (important).
- `templates/` directory, `index.html` and `theme.json` (see the [FSE-specific theme files](#theme-structure) below).

### Optional
- The [Gutenberg Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) is not required, but adds extra Gutenberg-specific functionality that is missed otherwise in WordPress core.
On a `roots.io` Bedrock site you usually would add the plugin to the Bedrock site (not the theme!) `composer.json` as a [WPackagist dependency](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=gutenberg&type=plugin).

## Please note
***Double-check whether `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` is absent from your theme setup, as otherwise FSE will not work.***

## Theme installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Invoke `composer install`.
3. (Optional) Ensure suitable `node` version, e.g. using `nvm` from the `.nvmrc` by invoking `nvm install && nvm use`.
4. Invoke either `npm install` or `yarn install` (`npm install -g yarn` for installing/updating yarn classic (`1.x`)).
5. (Remove either `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`, depending on the package manager you are using, as `bud` will not build otherwise in order to prevent potential issues.)
6. Invoke `npm run build`.
7. (Mount the theme into a WordPress site and activate it).
8. Open the Site Editor:
  - Admin area → `Appearance` → `Editor (beta)`
  - (Logged in as `editor`+) → Front end → Admin bar → `Edit site`

```

## Notes

- You can [register the frontend styles as editor styles](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/app/setup.php#L30-L40), then Gutenberg Editor will automatically post-process those styles and wrap all selectors in `.editor-styles-wrapper` for proper styles isolation (which prevents those frontend styles leaking into the editor UI itself). The editor styles are added as they are/were added to the TinyMCE editor (WordPress Classic Editor).
This allows the theme to be agnostic towards the technique with which the Gutenberg editor isolates the frontend styles (from its UI). This becomes more important now as in the near future Gutenberg will use `iframe`s. Therefore hardcoded style isolation (by prefixing a editor-styles-wrapper CSS class selector) would then either be unnecessary or even require additional post-processing which itself was intended to be avoided in the first place.
- You can also add editor-specific styles for adjusting the DOM elements added by the editor or the editor UI itself (for specific fixes). Those editor styles, even if they may be named "editor styles", would not be added as editor style (as it is called in WordPress) in a technical sense, but rather just [enqueued on the admin/backend editor pages](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/app/setup.php#L21-L28) as normal styles (which would not be post-processed and hence isolated by Gutenberg editor either) (as by using `enqueue_block_editor_assets`).
- `add_theme_support('block-templates')` is not needed when theme is already autodetected to be a FSE theme (by presence of `theme.json` and `templates/`).
- Disabling FSE using `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` is ignored when block templates are in place, `Design → Editor` is still offered to the user. – But this will currently result in an [unexpected, non-JSON-, HTML-response for `_wp-find-template`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170#issuecomment-1287434694), preventing the Gutenberg Editor from initializing, hence the Gutenberg Editor page stays blank.
- Block styles currently can not be registered by convention (as by adding them as files into a specific folder, using meta data as comments/JSON, as this is already possible with block patterns). – Currently block styles can only be registered using [`register_block_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_style/) (in server-side PHP; recommended `init` action hook) or [`registerBlockStyle`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-styles/) (in editor JavaScript). This can change with future releases of Gutenberg and WordPress core.
- Get the translation source strings using the WP CLI [`i18n`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/i18n/), as this tool is able to parse not only the normal core PHP WordPress translation functions, but also all the metadata in `theme.json`; Block patterns and Block parts for color, font-size, block part names, etc. – And recently it can also parse [Blade-PHP template files](https://github.com/wp-cli/i18n-command/pull/304). Sage 10 already uses these for its [translation-related `npm` scripts](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/package.json#L14).
- In case you are wondering why no page header/footer is visible, this depends on the WordPress Reading settings (`Your latest post` or `A static page` under `Settings` → `Reading` → `Your homepage displays`).
- You can easily add SCSS/SASS (+ PostCSS) support, just apply the [adjustments](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-scss/commits/master) made to the [Sage 10 SCSS](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-scss) theme.
- The great [`bud-wp-editor-query`](https://github.com/talss89/bud-wp-editor-query) plugin allows to add editor-specific styles directly in the frontend styles, using a custom and valid CSS media query syntax. An example is included in the [`app.css`](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/resources/styles/app.css#L6-L12).

## Known issues and fixes

### Template part blocks can not render; JavaScript error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tinymce' [...]` in Gutenberg Editor

Block template or block parts contain plain, "naked" HTML without block-specific comments.

#### Related issues

- <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55043>
- <https://github.com/bobbingwide/sb/issues/6>

### Customization by user
By default, the user can override the theme-provided block templates and block parts, those modifications are stored as special posts in database.
The site editor sidebar can be opened by clicking on the logo/icon on the upper left corner in the side editor.
From that sidebar the block templates and template parts lists can be viewed and the user customizations reset.

### Home versus Front page templates
This was a gotcha for me, as I first had not completely understood the exact difference between those two.
This very well made article explains the differences:
https://davidsutoyo.com/articles/difference-front-page-php-home-php/

### Gutenberg Editor/JavaScript errors like `Block "core/post-comments" is not registered` (for _comment_-specific core blocks)
The [`Disable Comments Plugin`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) may cause this as it can also remove the comment-specific core blocks.
Note: In block templates those blocks have markup as `<!-- wp:post-comment`.

### Gutenberg Editor/JavaScript errors like `Block "core/post-title" is not registered` (for _blog-_/_post_-specific core blocks)
The [`Disable Blog Plugin`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-blog/) may cause this as it can also remove the blog-/post-specific core blocks.
Note: In block templates those blocks have markup as `<!-- wp:post-title`.

### The Gutenberg Editor page loads, but stays blank! 😮
This happens when the backend sends an unexpected response (invalid JSON (so also just frontend HTML)) or no response. The Gutenberg Editor [currently catches any JSON parse errors and silently stops initializing](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170) (staying blank). 
Adding or changing the order of template loaders can cause this, hence this example Sage 10 FSE theme uses a patched version of the Sage theme `acorn` runtime that does not respond [with a matching Blade-PHP non-block template](https://github.com/roots/acorn/issues/228).
Also the aforementioned [disabling FSE using `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` in a FSE theme](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170#issuecomment-1287434694) causes this.
